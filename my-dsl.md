# Language
_What is the name of the language? Link the name to its webpage 
(if appropriate)._

The language is the [Fuzzy Control Language](http://ffll.sourceforge.net/fcl.htm).

# Domain
_Describe the language's domain in five words._

Fuzzy logic instead of booleans.

# Computational model
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of 
what happens when a program in your DSL runs._

In simple terms, when a program written in a domain-specific language is run, its purpose is to generate specific code that can be integrated into the application that implements it. In the case of FCL, this would involve the generation of a set of rules and categories beyond the scope of booleans that could be interpreted by its parent application. For ContextFree, a specific set of terms (eg. `CIRCLE`) are being transformed into code that the parent application is capable of parsing. In either case, the language is an interface between the user and the parent application that enables the user to perform a specific task within the greater context of that application. 

# DSL-ness
_Fowler writes about a spectrum of languages, from general-purpose languages to 
"purely" domain-specific. Where does the DSL you chose fall on this spectrum, 
and why?_ 

FCL is closer to the general-purpose end of the spectrum because some programming logic (if/else, variable declaration) can be expressed in the language. It is possible that Fowler would even say that this does not qualify as a DSL for similar reasons he argues against R. However, the domain-specific features of the language are how programs become organized into sets of rules (termed `RULES`) and how fuzzy variables are categorized based on the user's definitions. FCL has limited features in that it does not implement loops or other capabilities of more complex languages.

# Internal or external?
_Is the language implemented as an internal or external DSL? 
Justify your answer._

The language is implemented as an external DSL, since it is intended to be a supplement to other programs. It can be used in other applications as a replacement for booleans. FCL has its own syntax separate from the application in which it is being used. Since the entire purpose of the language is to implement fuzzy logic, FCL has its own unique features and is not merely a subset of features of another language, which would be characteristic of an internal DSL. 

# Host language
_What language(s) was (were) used to implement the DSL?_

FCL is a set of standards defined in the IEC 61131-7 standard for programmable controllers. Compilers and parsers for FCL have been implemented in several different languages. The language itself is constrained by the aforementioned standards. One example of an FCL library is jFuzzyLogic, which is an implementation of FCL in Java.

# Benefits
_Identify one potential benefit of the DSL: how is a programmer's life or a 
company's bottom line made easier by the existence of this language?_

Using this DSL, programmers can easily make use of fuzzy logic. With FCL, the programmer can define a set of general rules to categorize fuzzy values (unknowns ranging from 0 to 1) in terms of the specific problem they are trying to solve. The language allows the user to add their own sets of objects and categories in order to solve fuzzy logic problems within their more specific domain. This customizability is very convenient when working in the context of a real-world problem in which the answer is not a simple true or false value.

# Drawbacks
_Identify one potential drawback of the DSL: what does a programmer or company 
lose by using this DSL instead of a general-purpose language?_

One potential drawback of the language is that it does not include many keywords. Though FCL is very user-friendly (statements begin to look more like sentences than code snippets), some inuitive modifiers do not exist in the language. For example, the language supports `IF` and `THEN` but does not include a variable modifier such as `VERY`, which would place the object being modified into a different category than if the modifier was not present. As mentioned before, the language does not support features of a more general-purpose language, such as loops. A user loses these features by choosing to use this particular DSL.
