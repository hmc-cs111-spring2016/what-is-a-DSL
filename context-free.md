# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
This seems to be for people who want to make cool art using written instructions (in the form of grammars). This is not a particularly expansive group of people -- probably just people who are bored or trying to make niche abstract-type art.

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
It seems easy to make repeated shapes and put them in various parts of the picture. It's easy because you can define exactly what a certain shape looks like just once, and then use it as many times as you want.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
It's hard to make art that doesn't have repeating patterns, something like a leaf found in nature or a human form. That is to say, it's difficult to make art that lacks form that can be described.

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
I flailed around unsuccessfully with the documentation for a while, which I found to be inconsistent (and also unhelpful, as ultimately it was a comparison to the newer version of the program -- the one they want you to use). Eventually I went and looked at some tutorials online, borrowing heavily from various tutorials and tinkering to my heart's content. I also went and looked at some ideas from other people who had already submitted -- I took the repeating figure idea from Josh Kutsko.

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._
I think that the basic idea here is that the program will go through the code looking further and further down into grammatical rules until it reaches primitive statements (built-in statements), at which point it is rendered by some kind of interpreter.

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
I don't think *too* much is interesting about the CF program I wrote, as I wrote it under considerable time crunch. That said, I tried to make a piece of art that was both aesthetically pleasing, and also incorporated artistic items of varying levels of complexity. For example, I have, to start, the plain standard black shapes. Then I have the "color wheel" component, which is essentially 36 lines of varying hues in a wheel around my simple triangle. This uses the idea of repeated shapes. I then end with a recursive figure, which is the repeating squares getting smaller and more opaque into unrenderability. I like this element because it is most complex and arguably most jarring, as it is off-center and lacking in cohesion with the rest of the piece.
